# Atreus42-Hand-Wired-Mechanical-Keyboard

Atreus 42 is a mechanical keyboard that I hand wired with salvaged Cherry MX switches from a broken keyboard, and an elite-C (atmega32u4 controller) controller.  I soldered the diodes, switches, and controller together by hand and flashed the firmware with command line inputs.

I programmed it with QMK which is an opensource C based program that lets you program micro controllers.
